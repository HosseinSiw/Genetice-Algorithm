# Genetice-Algorithm
The genetic algorithm is a meta-heuristic algorithm that is implemented based on the theory of survival of the fittest
This algorithm is used in random optimization

For example, this algorithm can be used to optimize the coefficients of machine learning regression models or to select audio or video data features.
As can be seen in the image of the neural network, the algorithm works in such a way that it randomly selects the most optimal subset by using different subsets of features.

The code of the algorithm is written in the file algorithm.py, I hope it is useful for you
